# ResNet50 Served to the Web Using Flask

ResNet50 is a deep learning model trained on the ImageNet dataset. This model is [imported from TensorFlow / Keras](https://keras.io/api/applications/resnet/#resnet50-function). 

The model is served over a [Flask](https://flask.palletsprojects.com/en/1.1.x/) web server and then run from a [Docker container](https://www.docker.com/resources/what-container).
